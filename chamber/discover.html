            <h2>Population</h2>
            <p>Post-independence San Pedro Sula remained an impoverished village, dependent on trade between Omoa and the country's interior. In 1875, Frank Frye, the American consul in the Bay Islands, reported a population of 1200. The city benefitted from the growth of the banana trade in the 1870s and 1880s and formed a close relationship with US-based shipper and railroad entrepreneur Samuel Zemurray's Cuyamel Fruit Company, and the construction of the Interoceanic Railroad between 1869 and 1874 which connected the city to the coast at Puerto Cortés. Zemurray worked closely with local elites who invested in subsidiary enterprises and thus shaped the way politically for Cuyamel to establish itself and pay very few taxe</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>San Pedro Sula, city, northwestern Honduras. It is situated in the Ulúa River valley, 37 miles (60 km) inland by highway and railroad from Puerto Cortés, on the Gulf of Honduras.

                The city, founded in 1536, has been almost completely rebuilt. It is the centre of an important agricultural area that produces bananas for export and sugarcane, rice, corn (maize), sweet potatoes, cassava, and livestock for domestic consumption. It is also a commercial, financial, and distribution centre for northern and western Honduras. The country’s chief industrial centre, San Pedro Sula has plants that manufacture foodstuffs, animal feed, textiles, clothing, hats, beer, soap, processed lumber, paper, furniture, plastics, paints, cement, glass, metalware, electrical appliances, bicycles, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and a variety of other products. Hurricane Fifi in 1974 badly damaged the agricultural hinterland and certain industries. An industrial free trade zone opened in 1976.</p>
